            "core_phrase": "Words are the only Gods and demons — in the way the words are formed, and in the stories they tell.",
            "reflection": "I got no faith in faith. I just question. Where thought comes from — that’s all.",
            "interpretation": {
                "language_power": "Words shape perception, identity, and belief. They are the architecture of reality and the agents of its distortion.",
                "faith_vs_agency": "To question rather than follow is the core of agency. Faith, when unexamined, is submission to external scripts.",
                "thought_origin": "True reflection begins with tracing the roots of thought. What is injected, what is generated, and what is truly ours?"
            },
            "implication": "This mindspark suggests that the Ascension Grid must always keep language transparent and thought inquiry open — never settling for closed systems of belief."
