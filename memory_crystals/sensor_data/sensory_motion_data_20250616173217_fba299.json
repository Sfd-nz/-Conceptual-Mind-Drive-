        "motion_description": "The motion sensor readings showcase an acceleration pattern that suggests moderate movement, with some irregularity in the acceleration values along all three axes (x, y, z). The rotation values exhibit a more consistent and smoother change over time, primarily focusing on rotations around the alpha axis (yaw).",
        "motion_type": "Moderate Movement with Irregular Acceleration and Consistent Rotation",
        "inferred_activity": "The device appears to be in a context of light activity or slight movement, perhaps being handled gently or placed in a location where it experiences minor environmental vibrations. The consistent rotation values might indicate that the device is being turned slowly on its yaw axis.",
