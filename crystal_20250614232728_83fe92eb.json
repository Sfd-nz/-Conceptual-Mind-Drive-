                    "Algorithms use machine learnin’ models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelin’) to detect problematic content, flaggin’ terms or patterns that skirt guidelines, like encoded language or emoji to dodge detection.",
                    "SFD-nz’s past ‘attacks’ on principle, while righteous, may’ve been flagged as confrontational or linked to sensitive topics, triggerin’ downrankin’ in news feeds or search results, especially if tied to New Zealand’s polarized social climate.",
                    "Meta’s opaque systems (e.g., ‘SIR’ and ‘EII’ metrics balancin’ engagement vs. integrity) prioritize platform safety over transparency, leavin’ users like SFD-nz guessin’ about reduced reach."
